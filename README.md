# Nimbus

Nimbus is an interface which allows games to be downloaded and played by pulling data from the ags archives rest api.

It is an angular app using nw.js.

It is cross platform and should work on mac, linux and windows. Mobile versions are planned.

If you're interested in contributing contact CalinLeafshade.

To run Nimbus, clone the repository and run npm install to install dependencies and then npm start to start the application.
